I'll examine the existing project to understand its current state and client requirements. Let me access the directory first:

Based on my thorough review of the existing cyberUXcellence website project, I now have a good understanding of the current implementation, client requirements, and project goals. Here's my assessment and plan for improvements on our new `updateSite2` branch:

## Current Project Status:

The cyberUXcellence website is a responsive single-page site designed to showcase the Cyber UXcellence Awards, which recognize cybersecurity products with exceptional user experience. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes sections for:

1. Hero/intro
2. About the awards
3. Award categories (8 total)
4. Why nominate section
5. Judges section (to be updated Apr 29, 2025)
6. Timeline
7. FAQ
8. CTA and sponsorship opportunities
9. Footer

The design uses a purple (#6a1b9a) and orange (#ff6d00) color scheme with clean typography and responsive layout.

## Client Requirements:

Based on the project documentation, the key requirements include:
- Responsive design across all devices
- Launch by April 4, 2025 (immediate deadline)
- HubSpot form integration
- Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and LinkedIn Insight Tag integration
- Clean, professional UX matching brand guidelines
- Secure deployment with SSL certificate
- Structure that allows for easy updates (especially the Judges section update on Apr 29)

## Improvement Plan for updateSite2 Branch:

I'll focus on enhancing the design, performance, and user experience of the site while maintaining its current structure. Here's my plan:
