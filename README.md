## How to Use These Fixes

### Option 1: Replace Files (Recommended)
1. Replace the existing `category-carousel-tier1.js` with the new version
2. Add the new `category-circles.css` to your project
3. Include a link to the CSS file in your HTML head:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="category-circles.css">
   ```

### Option 2: Use the Updated Index File
1. Copy the content from `index-updated.html` to your existing `index.html`
2. Make sure to preserve any custom content specific to your site

### Option 3: Progressive Enhancement
1. Add all new files to your project
2. Include the `update-head.js` script at the end of your body:
   ```html
   <script src="update-head.js"></script>
   ```

## Testing
After implementing these changes, the circular category navigation should:
- Display properly with correct positioning
- Show icons inside each circle
- Highlight the active category
- Show the corresponding category content
- Work responsively on mobile devices
