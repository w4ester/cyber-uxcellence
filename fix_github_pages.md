# Steps Taken to Fix GitHub Pages Site

1. I checked the file structure in your Git repository and confirmed that:
   - Your `index.html` file is at the root level, which is correct
   - All required CSS, JavaScript, and image files are also at the correct paths

2. To fix the GitHub Pages site not showing content at https://w4ester.github.io/cyber-uxcellence:

   **Option 1: Edit repository settings directly on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/w4ester/cyber-uxcellence/settings/pages
   - Make sure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Set "Branch" to "main" and folder to "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait 1-3 minutes for deployment to complete

   **Option 2: Force a redeployment by making a small change**
   - Add a simple comment to your index.html file
   - Commit and push the change 
   - This will trigger a new GitHub Pages build

   **Option 3: Check if the site is published at a different URL**
   - GitHub sometimes uses the repository name in the URL
   - Try accessing https://w4ester.github.io/cyber-uxcellence/ (with trailing slash)
   - Also check the repository settings page for the correct URL

3. If these steps don't resolve the issue:
   - Check the Actions tab in GitHub repository for any deployment errors
   - Ensure the .nojekyll file exists to prevent Jekyll processing
   - Create a minimal test page to verify GitHub Pages is working
