Subject: Re: Cyber UXcellence Website Progress Update

Hi Kim and Branddy,

1. The website will be ready by April 4th for making sure we have it set the way you envision, and then can work with team in parallel this week (ACES team) to make sure site is secure, hosted and deployed by no later than April 8. Completed most of the core design and functionality - and we just need to finalize content, integrate the HubSpot form(s), and deploy. For the interim period, we'll implement an attractive "Nominations Opening Soon" banner that can be seamlessly switched to active nomination mode when ready for gathering nominations.

2. For the judges section, designed a professional grid layout that accommodates headshots (ideally 250x250px). Each bio should be 100-150 words to maintain visual balance and readability. The design comfortably features 6-12 judges with their name, title, organization, and bio. Should you need to showcase more judges, we can easily adapt the layout to maintain the premium look and feel.

3. Regarding the technical integration, I haven't connected directly with team beyond my response to email with J. Hawk included. However, I am glad to take that lead if you share with me ACES contacts and request that was sent via Assana. I am glad to complete with the team, and we can discuss during our meeting tomorrow afternoon. And have things ready to connect going from the meeting to deployment goal date of April 8 but with my internal motivated goal of April 4. 

4. Tomorrow we can get:
   - Access to Branddy's HubSpot portal
   - Confirmation of your desired nomination form fields
   - Your preferences for notification workflow finalized

5. Thank you, and look forward to connecting with Mike regarding payment details. And I really am glad to get get details from ACES ticket you've created with the ACES team Branddy and I can take it from there and work directly with them on securing, hosting, and deploying the site to ensure everything meets your expectations.

See you later today for our virtual meeting. 

Best,
Will
