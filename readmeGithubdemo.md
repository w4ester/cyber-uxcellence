# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

To quickly deploy this site using GitHub Pages for free:

1. Go to your GitHub repository at https://github.com/w4ester/cyberUXcellence
2. Click on "Settings" at the top right of the repository
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section (or click on "Pages" in the left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch from the dropdown
5. Leave the folder as "/ (root)"
6. Click "Save"

GitHub will then publish your site. After a minute or so, you'll see a message saying "Your site is published at https://w4ester.github.io/cyberUXcellence/"

Your site will be instantly available at: https://w4ester.github.io/cyberUXcellence/

## Benefits of GitHub Pages for Demo

- **Zero Configuration Needed**: GitHub Pages works out of the box with static websites
- **Free Hosting**: No costs for hosting the demo site
- **Fast Deployment**: Changes pushed to main are automatically deployed
- **SSL Included**: Your site gets HTTPS by default
- **Reliable**: Built on GitHub's infrastructure for dependability

## Sharing with Stakeholders

The GitHub Pages URL can be shared with anyone, and they don't need a GitHub account to view it. This makes it perfect for stakeholder reviews.

For a more polished presentation, you could also set up a custom domain later, but the github.io URL works perfectly for internal demos.
