Cyber UXcellence

[Baltimore, MD] April 8th, 2025— Mindgrub, a leader in technology innovation, product UX/UI, and digital experiences, is excited to announce that nominations for the inaugural Cyber UXcellence Awards will officially open on April 8, 2025. This new awards program recognizes cybersecurity product teams that are making security tools more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly — raising the bar for product design across the cybersecurity industry.
"If a security product isn’t intuitive and easy to use, it becomes shelfware—unused and ineffective," said (TBD), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). "Exceptional user experience isn’t just a luxury in cybersecurity; it’s a necessity. Without it, even the most powerful security solutions fail to protect organizations the way they should."
Unlike traditional awards programs, companies are encouraged to nominate their own products and teams for consideration. This allows product managers, UX designers, and security innovators to showcase their work directly and gain industry-wide recognition for their commitment to user-centered design.
“In cybersecurity, great design isn’t just a nice-to-have — it directly impacts adoption, reduces human error, and ultimately strengthens security posture,” said Todd Marks, CEO of Mindgrub. “We’ve seen how smart UX improvements can cut user activation time and drive higher monthly revenue. With the Cyber UXcellence Awards, we’re celebrating the product teams proving that investing in UX doesn’t just make products easier to use — it makes them essential to the success and security of the business.”
In a digital landscape where threats are increasingly complex, user experience plays a pivotal role in ensuring security tools are adopted and used to their full potential. The Cyber UXcellence Awards aim to elevate the importance of UX in cybersecurity and set new industry benchmarks for usability and design.
The awards will recognize top cybersecurity products across multiple categories, with a focus on those that successfully combine innovative technology with exceptional user experience. Finalists and winners will be celebrated at Black Hat 2025 in Las Vegas, with the judging panel to be announced during an exclusive event at the RSA Conference.
