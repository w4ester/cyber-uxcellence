Subject: Re: Cyber UXcellence Website Progress Update

Hi Kim and Branddy,

1. Current website status: All core design and functionality implemented with responsive UI. Live staging version can be viewed at: https://w4ester.github.io/cyber-uxcellence/

2. At the github repo you can find detailed roadmaps established:
   - **April 4 Readiness Plan**: Final review with all sections, responsive design, HubSpot integration, and documentation
   - **April 8 Deployment Plan**: Full launch with security implementation, monitoring setup, and post-launch support

3. For the judges section, designed a professional grid layout that accommodates headshots (ideally 250x250px). Each bio should be 100-150 words to maintain visual balance and readability.

4. Website access:
   - GitHub repository: https://github.com/w4ester/cyber-uxcellence
   - Live site URL: https://w4ester.github.io/cyber-uxcellence/ (deployed from root directory)

5. Tomorrow we can get:
   - Access to Branddy's HubSpot portal for connection to CRM
   - Confirmation of your desired nomination form fields
   - Your preferences for notification workflow finalized

6. If you can share with me the ACES ticket created and where that stands, I am glad to work directly with the ACES team on securing, hosting, and deploying the site to ensure everything meets your expectations by April 8.

See you later today for our virtual meeting, look forward to delivering this site April 4 and April 8!

Best,
Will
