## 2. Hosting Environment Setup

### Recommended Hosting Options

#### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Simplest)
- **Pros**: Free, easy integration with current GitHub repository, simple deployment
- **Cons**: Limited functionality for complex features, no server-side processing

#### Option 2: AWS S3 + CloudFront
- **Pros**: Scalable, excellent performance, global CDN, good security
- **Cons**: Requires AWS expertise, slightly more complex setup

#### Option 3: Netlify/Vercel
- **Pros**: Easy GitHub integration, automatic deployments, free SSL, preview deployments
- **Cons**: Some advanced features require paid plans

### Domain Configuration

1. Purchase/prepare domain name (cyberuxcellence.com)
2. Set up DNS records:
   - A record pointing to hosting provider
   - CNAME for www subdomain
   - MX records for email services
   - TXT records for domain verification

### Technical Requirements

- Node.js v16+ (for build tools)
- Git for version control
- Static site hosting capability
- Support for SSL/TLS certificates
- Support for custom domains

## 3. Security Implementation

### SSL Certificate Setup

1. Generate SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended for free option)
2. Install certificate on web server
3. Configure automatic renewal (every 90 days)
4. Test HTTPS functionality
5. Implement HSTS header

### Security Headers

Implement the following HTTP security headers:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://js.hsforms.net https://snap.licdn.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://unpkg.com; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com; img-src 'self' data: https://www.googletagmanager.com;
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

### Form Security

1. Implement CSRF protection
2. Add rate limiting for form submissions (max 10 per IP per hour)
3. Configure HubSpot reCAPTCHA integration
4. Sanitize all user inputs

### Additional Security Measures

1. Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection
2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
3. Configure secure cookie attributes
4. Set up security monitoring and scanning

## 4. Deployment Workflow

### GitHub-Based Workflow

1. **Development Environment (Local)**
   - Clone repository
   - Create feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/name`)
   - Make changes and commit locally
   - Test locally using `python -m http.server` or similar
   - Push to remote repository

2. **Quality Assurance (Staging)**
   - Create pull request to merge feature branch to staging branch
   - Automatic deployment to staging environment
   - Run automated tests (accessibility, performance)
   - Conduct manual testing and review
   - Address any issues discovered

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Create pull request from staging to main branch
   - Final review and approval
   - Merge to main triggers production deployment
   - Verify deployment success
   - Run post-deployment checks

### Continuous Integration/Deployment

#### Option 1: GitHub Actions

```yaml
# Sample workflow for GitHub Pages
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
