**About The Awards**

(Sub-heading)  
The **Cyber UXcellence Awards** recognize cybersecurity products that set the standard for exceptional **user experience (UX) and user interface (UI)**.

Security tools should be powerful—but they also need to be **intuitive, efficient, and easy to use**. Despite this necessity, the crucial impact of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design on strengthening security often goes unnoticed or undervalued in the industry. If a product is difficult to navigate, slows workflows, or requires extensive training, it risks being underutilized. Great UX ensures security solutions are **adopted, trusted, and effective**.

These awards highlight cybersecurity products that excel in:  
  ✓ **Usability** – Intuitive design that simplifies security, not complicates it  
  ✓ **Adoption** – Seamless user experiences that drive engagement and minimize friction  
  ✓ **Impact** – UX that enhances security outcomes and business efficiency

By recognizing **the best** in cybersecurity UX, the **Cyber UXcellence Awards** help raise the bar for the entire industry—because security should be as **usable** as it is **strong**.
